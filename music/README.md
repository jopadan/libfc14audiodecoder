This is just a dumping ground for modules that have been **repaired**:  

 * The soundtrack modules from the game ``Chambers of Shaolin`` as included
with Future Composer v1.2 and v1.3 in SMOD format are broken (since their
conversion from TFMX has introduced mistakes), but have been copied into
many module collections.  

 * ``wassermu.hipc`` (short for Wassermusik) in compressed TFMX format
raises doubts. It is Chambers of Shaolin "ingame 1" aka "Test of Balance",
but with some added/restored patterns playing on voice 4. Strangely, one
of the instruments is broken compared with the original TFMX version (and
also the FC conversion).  

 * ``Dreamcave.hipc`` is missing sample data in some module collections.
Sometimes it is found in a separate file named "hipc.samp", in other cases
the separate file is named "smp.set" but is stored in a different path.
Searching for it and loading it would not be worthwhile.
